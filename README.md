# Blackjack

In the dynamic world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the pursuit of optimal decision
making strategies is a continuous endeavour. This project embarks on this journey, utilizing the Monte
Carlo Control method in tandem with Epsilon Greedy policies to train an agent in the classic game of
Blackjack. Briefly , Blackjack might seem straightforward, but it presents a multifaceted enviro nment
ideal for delving into the intricacies of decision making amidst uncertainty.

The project is rooted in the expansive domain of Reinforcement Learning (RL), drawing significant inspiration from the seminal work of Sutton & Barto. It also encompasses studies focusing on machine learning for optimal blackjack counting strategies and the utilization of Blackjack as a fertile ground for testing learning strategies in neural networks.
In the provided implementation, an RL agent was developed using Monte Carlo Control with Epsilon-Greedy policies to engage in Blackjack. The environment was orchestrated using the renowned gym library, which is in harmony with the background research cited.
